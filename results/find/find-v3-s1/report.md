# FIND results: find-v3-s1

Sample: `bench/find/data`; up to 25 learn steps per function; exam of 4 probes (v2 arms). Scores are FIND's official code-based metrics: numeric = share of functions with normalised error < 0.1 on x in [-127.5, 127.5]; strings = share of FIND's test pairs reproduced exactly. `at 3` / `at 10` = the score of the model each run had after 3 / 10 experiments (FIND's GPT-4 agent used a median of about 3). `experiments` excludes the exam, which adds 4 probes per v2 run; `inputs` is every value sent to the function, exam included. Cost at DeepSeek's list price.
